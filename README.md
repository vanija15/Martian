Overview of solution for the task in a sequential format:

1. **Project Setup**:
   - Create a new Python project and set up a virtual environment.
   - Install the required dependencies: `fastapi`, `uvicorn`, and the official Python libraries for the chosen model providers (e.g., `openai`, `anthropic`, `together`).

2. **Create the Project Structure**:
   ```plaintext
   my_library/
   │
   ├── providers/
   │   ├── __init__.py
   │   ├── base_provider.py
   │   ├── openai_provider.py
   │   ├── anthropic_provider.py
   │   └── together_provider.py
   │
   ├── models/
   │   ├── __init__.py
   │   ├── request_models.py
   │   └── response_models.py
   │
   ├── routes/
   │   ├── __init__.py
   │   ├── openai_routes.py
   │   ├── anthropic_routes.py
   │   └── together_routes.py
   │
   ├── utils/
   │   ├── __init__.py
   │   ├── api_utils.py
   │   └── exceptions.py
   │
   ├── main.py
   ├── requirements.txt
   └── tests/
       ├── __init__.py
       ├── test_providers.py
       └── test_routes.py
   ```

3. **Implement the Abstraction Layer**:
   - In `providers/base_provider.py`, define an abstract base class `BaseProvider` with methods for common operations like setting API keys, making requests, and processing responses.
   - In `providers/openai_provider.py`, `providers/anthropic_provider.py`, and `providers/together_provider.py`, create concrete implementations of `BaseProvider` for each provider, implementing provider-specific logic.

4. **Define Request and Response Models**:
   - In `models/request_models.py`, define request models using `pydantic` or `typing` for data validation.
   - In `models/response_models.py`, define response models for the different providers.

5. **Implement Utility Functions**:
   - In `utils/api_utils.py`, define utility functions for making HTTP requests, handling authentication, and processing responses.
   - In `utils/exceptions.py`, define a custom exception hierarchy for handling different types of errors (e.g., `InvalidAPIKeyError`, `RateLimitError`, `ProviderSpecificError`).

6. **Create FastAPI Routes**:
   - In `routes/openai_routes.py`, `routes/anthropic_routes.py`, and `routes/together_routes.py`, define FastAPI routes for handling HTTP requests.
   - Import the corresponding provider class from the `providers` module and instantiate it.
   - Use FastAPI's dependency injection to inject the provider instance into the route handlers.
   - Call the provider's methods with the provided parameters and return the response.

7. **Set Up the FastAPI Application**:
   - In `main.py`, create a FastAPI application instance.
   - Import and include the routes from the `routes` module.

8. **Write Tests**:
   - In `tests/test_providers.py`, write unit tests for the provider classes, ensuring they handle different scenarios correctly (e.g., successful and failed requests, authentication, error handling).
   - In `tests/test_routes.py`, write integration tests to verify the behavior of the FastAPI routes and the integration between the routes and provider classes.
   - Use a testing library like `pytest` and a mocking library like `unittest.mock` or `pytest-mock` to mock external dependencies during testing.

9. **Implement Error Handling**:
   - In the provider classes and route handlers, catch and handle exceptions appropriately, returning informative error responses to the client.

10. **Write Documentation**:
    - Use Python's built-in `docstrings` to document the classes, methods, and functions in your library.
    - Generate HTML documentation from the docstrings using a tool like `pdoc` or `Sphinx`.
    - Provide installation instructions, usage examples, and information about supported model providers in a `README.md` file.

11. **Test for Scalability**:
    - Deploy your FastAPI application to a cloud platform or server.
    - Use load testing tools like `Locust` or `JMeter` to simulate concurrent users and test the application's scalability.
    - Monitor performance and resource usage to identify and address potential bottlenecks.

12. **Implement Caching and Optimizations (Optional)**:
    - Explore implementing caching mechanisms and performance optimizations to improve the library's efficiency.
    - Consider using asynchronous programming techniques with FastAPI for handling concurrent requests more efficiently.
    - Utilize a task queue like `Celery` or `RQ` for long-running or computationally intensive tasks to avoid blocking the main event loop.

13. **Continuous Improvement**:
    - Add support for more model providers by creating new classes that inherit from `BaseProvider`.
    - Enhance the library's functionality and optimize performance based on user feedback and evolving requirements.

Remember, throughout the development process, ensure that your code is well-organized, modular, and maintainable. Follow best practices for Python coding, adhere to the OpenAI format and documentation, and prioritize error handling and scalability.
